# Characteristic Length Scales from 1D Spatial Data

CLS1D provides facilities for computing the characteristic length
scale of ecological systems from one dimensional spatial data.


## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package. 

```R
devtools::install_github("DelphiWard/CLS1D")
```

If you don't have `devtools` installed already, install it first. 

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

(CLS1D otherwise does not need devtools for normal use.)
