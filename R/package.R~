#' Binary Mixtures of Linear Models
#'
#' Fit a binary mixture of linear models by Gibbs sampling.  Assumes
#' responses are drawn two subpopulations, each described by a
#' different linear model, and it is unknown which responses are drawn
#' from which subpopulation.  The mixture model estimates the
#' coefficient of the two subpopulation models and the probability
#' that an observation is drawn from a particular subpopulation.
